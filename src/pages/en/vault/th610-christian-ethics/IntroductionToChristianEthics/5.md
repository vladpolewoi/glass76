# Chapter 5 The Greatest Good For The Greatest Number?

### **The Limitations of Teleology**

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Hard to predict outcomes**: Teleological ethics relies on achieving good results, but the future is uncertain.
> - **Difficulty of knowing “the good”**: Even in moral realism, we struggle to fully grasp which goods outrank others (e.g., career vs. family).
> - **Compounding complexity in groups**: More people involved → harder to agree on real goods rather than compromise.
> - **Aristotle and Augustine recognized** these challenges: moral knowledge develops slowly, and lived experience or authoritative tradition might be needed before teleology can guide practical decisions.

##### **Summary:**

1. **Uncertainty About the Future**

   - In teleological ethics, “right” choices aim at _good outcomes_.
   - Because success is uncertain, the method offers little guidance _before_ deciding.

2. **Knowing the Good**

   - Even for realists like Aristotle or Augustine, _deciphering which goods outrank others_ (work vs. family, success vs. service) can be obscure.
   - It often takes _accumulated wisdom_ to see the right order among competing genuine goods.

3. **Challenges for Collective Decisions**

   - When groups must choose, it’s even tougher for all to share one vision of “the good.”
   - Spouses or close communities sometimes manage, but large-scale consensus on teleological goals is _rare_.

4. **Aristotle and Augustine’s Caution**

   - Aristotle: novices may lack the experience to do teleology well.
   - Augustine: fully knowing creation’s true order requires virtues shaped by a lifelong process of loving God correctly.

5. **Authority and Tradition**

   - Augustine expected the church’s wisdom to offer a more complete map of genuine goods.
   - Over centuries, Christians often relied on strong communal traditions; however, in modern contexts, those shared frameworks have weakened.

6. **Shift from Goals to Rules**
   - Given these complications, Christian ethics often pivots toward _rules and duties_ instead of a purely goals-based approach.
   - Later chapters explore how modern thinkers adapted teleology with different understandings of the good.
