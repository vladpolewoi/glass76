# Good, Goals, and God

### Goods, Goals, and God

> [!tip] Keynotes
>
> - People use **three main methods** of moral reasoning: **goals (teleology)**, **duties**, and **virtues**.
> - **Christian ethics**, like Aristotle's, often starts with **goals**—but orients them around **love for God**.
> - A **stance** helps people interpret and make moral choices—it’s unavoidable, even for secular people.
> - **Different stances → different conclusions**. But all choices still need to be made, even when answers are hard.
> - Ethics isn’t abstract—it’s about concrete, daily **decisions shaped by worldview**.

#### Summary:

1. **Everyday Moral Problems Need Action**
   - Ethics becomes real when it answers: _What should I do_?  
      → Cheating, helping friends, family emergencies, career choices, war, etc.
   - The Christian stance _informs_ but doesn’t _decide_ — we must still choose.
2. **Everyone Has a Stance**
   - Christians aren't the only ones with a worldview.
   - _Stoic?_ Value self-control.
   - _Epicurean?_ Seek calm pleasures and avoid pain.
   - _Modern secularist?_ Trust natural processes, avoid illusions of cosmic meaning.
3. **Your Stance Shapes Your Ethics**
   - Stance = worldview + values → enables moral reasoning.
   - No one makes moral choices “objectively” or from a vacuum.
   - Without a stance, choices lose meaning and ownership.
4. **Common Traditions Help, But Not Always Shared**
   - Religious or moral traditions offer long-developed guidance.
   - But in diverse societies, people won’t always share one stance.
   - The challenge is not to get everyone to agree, but to **know where _you_ begin**.

### Ways of Reasoning

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - There are **three major ways** to reason morally: **goals (teleology)**, **duties (deontology)**, and **virtues (areteology)**.
> - Christian ethics draws from all three, depending on the problem at hand.
> - **Teleology** asks: _What good outcome am I aiming for?_
> - **Deontology** asks: _What is the right thing to do, no matter the outcome?_
> - **Virtue ethics** asks: _What kind of person should I be?_
> - Real moral reasoning connects your **decisions** to your **whole life**, not just a one-time act.

#### Three Examples of Everyday Reasoning:

1. “The people I admire make sacrifices for the team...”  
   → _Virtue-based_: You aim to be loyal, dependable—a team player.
2. “It’s just wrong to lie.”  
   → _Duty-based_: Rules apply to everyone. You act from principle.
3. “Borrowing money from friends ruins friendships.”  
   → _Goal-based_: You act to avoid harm and preserve relationships.

#### Formal Terms:

| Name           | Origin           | Focus                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deontology** | _Deon_ (duty)    | Doing what is right, following rules or principles. |
| **Teleology**  | _Telos_ (goal)   | Achieving good outcomes or fulfilling a purpose.    |
| **Areteology** | _Arete_ (virtue) | Becoming a good person with admirable character.    |

---

#### In Practice:

- Most people blend these three forms of reasoning.
- The challenge: don’t just “jump between them” to justify what you already wanted to do.
- Ethical maturity means **knowing when and how** to apply the right kind of reasoning to the right kind of problem.

### Seeking Goals: Teleological Ethics

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - **Teleology** is reasoning based on _goals_: what good outcome should this action aim to produce?
> - **Goods** include both things found in nature (like mountains or sunsets) and things we bring into being (like relationships, careers, books, or institutions).
> - Some goods are **instrumental** (they help achieve other goals), others are **intrinsic** (valuable in themselves), and many are **a mix**.
> - Conflicts between goals (like _security vs. creativity_, or _study vs. fun_) push us to prioritize what matters most.
> - **Different thinkers** define “good”:
>   - _Plato_: good is what reflects eternal truth.
>   - _Augustine_: good is what reflects God and our relation to God.
>   - _Utilitarians_: good is what maximizes pleasure or minimizes pain.
> - In daily life and work, teleological thinking is _everywhere_—setting goals, balancing them, and judging success based on results.

---

#### In short:

**Teleology** = _goal-based ethics_.

- A _good action_ produces good results.
- A _good person_ accomplishes good things.
- Moral clarity comes from thinking about which goals are **really worth pursuing**—and how they fit together.

### Christian Teleological Ethics

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - **Aristotle**: Happiness (_eudaimonia_) is the goal of human life, achieved by acquiring goods (like health, honor, wisdom) and virtues over a lifetime.
> - **Early Christians**, however, flipped this: true happiness (_makarios_) is not wealth or honor but being **meek, merciful, pure, and persecuted** (see _Matthew 5_).
> - **Augustine** redefined happiness as _loving God_, the only good that cannot be lost. All other goods are useful but not ultimate.
>   - Material things, public roles, philosophy, even people — all should be _used_, not _loved_, lest they distract from God.
>   - Even the classical virtues must serve this love:
>     - **Temperance** = love preserving itself for God
>     - **Courage** = love enduring for God
>     - **Justice** = love that serves God and governs rightly
>     - **Prudence** = love that distinguishes helpful vs. harmful paths to God
> - Because of **sin**, humans often choose wrongly and live anxiously, clinging to temporary goods.
> - **True happiness** begins not by building up goods and reflecting on them (as in Aristotle), but by first **loving God**, which reorders all other loves.

---

#### In short:

**Christian teleology** starts not with _achieving happiness_, but with _loving God_, who _is_ our happiness.

- All other goods (even good people and virtues) are tools to help that journey — never the destination.
- A life aimed at God transforms how we use, value, and let go of everything else.

### **Radical Monotheism**

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - God alone can secure true happiness.
> - Niebuhr’s “Radical Monotheism” vs. **polytheism** (many shifting goods) and **henotheism** (one good against all others).
> - All creation is good in varying degrees—evil is a _lack_ of good, not a rival force.
> - **Sin = disordered love** that misplaces value (e.g., loving Rome or wealth too much).
> - **Theocentrism** reorders how we see ourselves, others, and society.
> - **Augustine vs. Aristotle**: ultimate love of God vs. building up personal eudaimonia.

##### Summary:

1. **God’s Unique Reality and Augustine’s Emphasis**

   - Augustine underscores that God stands apart from creation and has no opposite power.
   - Only love for this Creator God—rather than created goods—can deliver true happiness.

2. **Niebuhr’s Radical Monotheism**
   - Many modern people behave like _polytheists_, chasing multiple loyalties.
   - Some are _henotheists_, giving exclusive devotion to one cause or group.
   - _Radical monotheism_ (theocentrism) places God at the center, so all other loyalties must be seen in reference to God.
3. **All Things Are Good, Yet Prone to Distortion**
   - Augustine rejects any true evil force: evil is simply the absence of good.
   - Since God is the source of all value, each thing’s goodness depends on its relation to God.
4. **Misplaced Love and the City of God**
   - Augustine wrote _City of God_ to show how overvaluing something like Rome leads to confusion.
   - When disaster strikes, a distorted sense of loyalty blocks us from seeing true priorities.
5. **Loving God First Reshapes Everything Else**
   - If we “use” worldly goods rightly and love God above all, we see ourselves and others more clearly.
   - True freedom emerges when we’re not dominated by desires or fears tied to lesser goods.
6. **Contrast: Augustine and Aristotle**
   - Augustine starts with God’s supremacy; happiness is secured by sustaining that relationship.
   - Aristotle’s approach centers on the individual building virtues and achievements for _eudaimonia_.
   - Augustine shifts focus to _loving God_ and thus rightly valuing neighbors—rather than merely achieving personal excellence.

### **Moral Realism**

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - Both Aristotle and Augustine are _moral realists_: Goodness is part of reality itself.
> - _Anti-realists/subjectivists_ (e.g., Epicureans) see goodness as determined by desires or perceptions.
> - For realists, “things are good” → we _ought_ to choose them; for anti-realists, “we call things good” → based on what _we desire or value_.
> - Christian (Augustinian) view: God’s creation inherently contains distinct forms of goodness; moral discernment recognizes that reality, rather than inventing it.

##### **Summary:**

1. **Common Ground in Goal-Directed Ethics**

   - Augustine emphasizes differences from Aristotle but still aligns with the _teleological_ view that “right” actions stem from pursuing genuine goods.
   - Both see goodness as an _objective feature_ of certain people, objects, or situations.

2. **Moral Realism Explained**

   - Like the reality of a table in another room, goodness exists whether or not we realize it.
   - Both Aristotle (eudaimonia) and Augustine (theocentric love) consider the goodness of things as independent of human preferences.

3. **Contrast: Epicurean Anti-Realism**

   - Epicureans believe the world is just atoms in motion; goodness is not “in” things, but depends on _how humans feel about them_.
   - Variants of anti-realism (ethical egoism or moral relativism) argue that “good” always refers back to _someone’s_ perspective or desire.

4. **Implications for Christian Thought**
   - Augustine’s view is that creation’s goodness comes from God’s ordering of reality.
   - “Right choices” are those that align with how God has structured the true, objective good—rather than simply satisfying individual or cultural preferences.

### **The Persistence of Moral Realism**

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - Aristotle and Augustine both embrace _moral realism_—goodness is part of the world’s structure.
> - Many people today still assume that _some goals really are good_, apart from personal desire.
> - A defining struggle in life: _competing real goods_, such as family vs. career or learning vs. service.
> - Christian theocentrism supports moral realism; yet others share this perspective too.
> - Moral anti-realism posits that “good” is just about _subjective satisfaction_, but many resist that view.

##### **Summary:**

1. **Aristotle and Augustine’s Shared Assumptions**

   - Both are _teleological thinkers_, connecting right actions to seeking genuine ends.
   - They consider goodness an _objective_ feature of the world, not merely a label we attach to what we like.

2. **Contemporary Relevance**

   - We do not read their works as outdated theories; rather, we still find _credible guidance_ in their moral frameworks.
   - Many people sense that “good” is _discoverable_—we can be right or wrong in choosing it.

3. **Real Goods vs. Desires**

   - Key life choices often involve _two genuinely good options_ with different values, e.g., a meaningful career vs. family time.
   - The _difficulty_ of such decisions suggests goodness is something we risk misjudging, rather than mere preference.

4. **Christian and Broader Moral Realism**
   - The Christian stance sees all goods ordered by God, but non-Christians can also hold a realist view of morality.
   - _Anti-realists_ say goodness is only about satisfying preferences; _realists_ persist in believing certain truths about good go deeper than desire.

### **The Limitations of Teleology**

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Hard to predict outcomes**: Teleological ethics relies on achieving good results, but the future is uncertain.
> - **Difficulty of knowing “the good”**: Even in moral realism, we struggle to fully grasp which goods outrank others (e.g., career vs. family).
> - **Compounding complexity in groups**: More people involved → harder to agree on real goods rather than compromise.
> - **Aristotle and Augustine recognized** these challenges: moral knowledge develops slowly, and lived experience or authoritative tradition might be needed before teleology can guide practical decisions.

##### **Summary:**

1. **Uncertainty About the Future**

   - In teleological ethics, “right” choices aim at _good outcomes_.
   - Because success is uncertain, the method offers little guidance _before_ deciding.

2. **Knowing the Good**

   - Even for realists like Aristotle or Augustine, _deciphering which goods outrank others_ (work vs. family, success vs. service) can be obscure.
   - It often takes _accumulated wisdom_ to see the right order among competing genuine goods.

3. **Challenges for Collective Decisions**

   - When groups must choose, it’s even tougher for all to share one vision of “the good.”
   - Spouses or close communities sometimes manage, but large-scale consensus on teleological goals is _rare_.

4. **Aristotle and Augustine’s Caution**

   - Aristotle: novices may lack the experience to do teleology well.
   - Augustine: fully knowing creation’s true order requires virtues shaped by a lifelong process of loving God correctly.

5. **Authority and Tradition**

   - Augustine expected the church’s wisdom to offer a more complete map of genuine goods.
   - Over centuries, Christians often relied on strong communal traditions; however, in modern contexts, those shared frameworks have weakened.

6. **Shift from Goals to Rules**
   - Given these complications, Christian ethics often pivots toward _rules and duties_ instead of a purely goals-based approach.
   - Later chapters explore how modern thinkers adapted teleology with different understandings of the good.
