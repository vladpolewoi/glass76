### Chapter 1

# The Master Argument of MacIntyre's "After Virtue"

## Short Summary

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - **Modern moral chaos** stems from the Enlightenment's rejection of tradition, telos, and virtue.
> - **MacIntyre** sees morality today as fragments of a lost ethical tradition.
> - He revives **Aristotle**, but addresses 4 problems: metaphysical biology, the lost polis, tragic evil, and changing virtue definitions.
> - **Practices**: Social activities with internal goods that require virtue to master.
> - **Narratives**: Life has moral meaning when seen as a story with purpose and roles.
> - **Traditions**: Living communities that sustain and refine moral practices and narratives over time.
> - **Virtues** help sustain practices, personal quests, and tradition’s evolution.
> - Moral life is a **communal quest** toward the human good (_telos_) in a story-shaped world.

**Kallenberg** explains **MacIntyre’s** core thesis: modern ethics is in crisis because it lost its connection to _telos_ (purpose), social practices, and historical traditions. _Enlightenment_ thinkers tried to rebuild morality from reason alone, but failed—leaving only _emotivism_, where moral claims become mere preferences.

###### **MacIntyre** responds by reviving Aristotelian ethics but reworks it using three key ideas:

- **Practices**: cooperative, social activities with internal goods, which cultivate virtues.
- **Narratives**: human lives gain unity and meaning through storytelling, not abstract reason.
- **Traditions**: historically extended arguments that embed both practices and narratives.

He shows that virtue is what enables individuals to flourish in their life story, within a tradition, and in pursuit of shared goods. In doing so, he overcomes Aristotle's limitations and offers a framework for moral reasoning that is grounded, coherent, and socially embodied.

#### What's All This Noise

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - Modern moral debates are broken.
> - We lost an older, shared way of thinking about morality.
> - **Emotivism** tries to explain this, but it doesn’t work well.
> - MacIntyre says we need to understand how history shaped our morals — and that might help fix things.

The author talks about how modern moral debates (about things like abortion or war) often turn into shouting matches and never get resolved. Philosopher **Alasdair MacIntyre** thinks this isn't just because people disagree — it's because something big and bad happened in the past: we lost a shared moral framework that used to help us make sense of right and wrong.

Now, we’re left with just pieces of that old system, and we argue using words like "justice" and "duty" without really agreeing on what they mean.

A theory called **emotivism** tries to explain this. It says moral statements (like "Murder is wrong") are just people expressing feelings ("Yuck to murder!") — not making true claims that can be argued with logic. But **MacIntyre** disagrees and says this view is flawed.

Instead of just arguing with **emotivism** directly, **MacIntyre** looks deeper — into history, culture, and how our moral thinking has changed over time. He says the modern “moral self” feels disconnected and lost because it doesn’t have a shared goal or place in society anymore.

#### The Failure of the Enlightenment Project

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - _Enlightenment_ thinkers tried to justify morality without tradition.
> - **Diderot** used desire, **Hume** emotion, **Kant** reason — all failed.
> - **Kierkegaard** showed no method can truly justify moral choices.
> - This failure left us with confused and endless moral debates.

Modern moral confusion comes from the failure of the _Enlightenment Project_ — a historical effort (starting in the 1700s) to create a solid, logical foundation for morality without relying on religion or tradition. **MacIntyre** says this project failed, and that failure helps explain why today’s moral arguments often go nowhere.

###### What happened:

1. **Diderot** tried to base morality on human desires — but couldn’t explain what to do when people want opposite things.

2. **Hume** said emotions (especially _sympathy_) drive moral actions, not logic. But he couldn’t explain why this one emotion should be more important than others — or why his idea seemed to reflect only his own culture.

3. **Kant** rejected emotions and said morality must be based on reason. He created a rule: only do things you’d want everyone else to do (like the Golden Rule). But his system had weird results — it could justify both silly rules ("Always eat mussels on Mondays") and bad ones ("Persecute people with different beliefs").

4. **Kierkegaard** liked Kant’s moral values but saw his logic as flawed too. He said people have to choose how to live (pleasure, duty, faith), but there’s no rational way to decide between them. You just have to _leap_ — make a deep, personal choice with no clear reason.

Each thinker tried to fix the problems left by the one before — but all of them failed. Hume says emotions matter, Kant says only reason matters, Kierkegaard says neither works. None of them could agree on how to justify morality. So the Enlightenment Project — the attempt to logically rebuild morality from scratch — collapsed.

#### Why the Enlightenment Project Had to Fail

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - _The Enlightenment_ failed because it rejected the idea of a human purpose (_telos_).
> - Without telos, moral rules lost meaning and grounding in facts.
> - **Utilitarianism** and **Kantian ethics** tried to replace it but couldn’t define “good” or justify morality.
> - Modern moral language is just fragments of older traditions, making debates empty and unresolved.
> - Protest dominates because no side can truly win or lose without shared moral foundations.

MacIntyre argues that the Enlightenment Project didn't just accidentally fail — it _had to_ fail. That’s because it abandoned the ancient idea of **telos** — the purpose or goal of human life — which was essential for making moral judgments meaningful.

###### In **Aristotle's model**, morality had three parts:

1. What humans are like in their raw, untaught state.

2. What humans are meant to become (their telos).

3. Moral rules that guide the transformation from 1 to 2.

But Enlightenment thinkers rejected this idea of purpose. They started with the “autonomous individual” and tried to invent morality from scratch. Without a shared vision of human purpose, their moral systems had no foundation — like trying to steer a ship with no destination.

###### This led to big problems:

- Moral rules lost their grounding in facts.

- Disagreements couldn’t be settled by reason.

- Theories like **utilitarianism** tried to fill the gap, but couldn’t explain what “good” really means.

- Even Kant’s system relied on vague, undefined concepts like “rights” and “justice” that originally made sense only within older traditions.

So, modern moral language (like “duty,” “rights,” “justice”) still exists, but it’s just leftover fragments from a past that gave them meaning. That’s why moral debates today often feel like angry protests with no clear winners — because there's no shared foundation for what we’re arguing about.

#### Nietzsche or Aristotle?

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - **Nietzsche** saw that “objective” morals are really just disguised personal power.
> - Without shared values, the strongest will dominate — leading to chaos or tyranny.
> - We must choose: _Nietzsche or Aristotle_ — “there is no third alternative.”

Philosopher **Nietzsche** believed that when people talk about “objective” morals, they’re really just hiding their personal opinions and power plays.

In a world without shared moral foundations, **strong-willed individuals** (those driven by power) will take over. Morality becomes just a fight of wills — whoever is loudest or strongest wins. This is dangerous, MacIntyre warns, because it opens the door to authoritarian figures (like **Hitler**) who impose their will without real moral justification.

The only way to stop this, MacIntyre says, is to return to the older, Aristotelian way of thinking — where morality is tied to a shared human purpose (_telos_). In his view, we now face a serious decision: **either follow Nietzsche** into a world of moral chaos and power struggles, **or return to Aristotle** and rebuild a meaningful moral tradition.

#### **In Praise of Aristotle**

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - _Homeric society_ saw virtue as fulfilling one’s fixed social role.
> - _Athens_ broadened virtue into personal excellence and sparked moral debate.
> - **Plato** sought ideal virtue, but ignored real-life moral conflicts.
> - **Aristotle** grounded morality in human purpose (_telos_) and flourishing (_eudaimonia_).
> - Moral life is social, guided by reason, and depends on virtues developed in community.

**MacIntyre** defends the Aristotelian tradition of morality by showing how it grew from Homeric storytelling to Aristotle's systematic virtue ethics. In Homer’s heroic society, moral values were tied to one's fixed role in a clan — you were virtuous by doing your duty well (like a warrior being brave). Over time, especially in Athens, these roles became less rigid, and the idea of virtue expanded.

Plato tried to redefine virtue as alignment with abstract ideals, but his model ignored real-life conflicts between duties. Aristotle advanced this tradition by grounding morality in human purpose (_telos_) — what humans are meant for. He believed that the goal of life is _eudaimonia_ (deep, flourishing happiness), and virtues are traits that help us achieve it.

###### MacIntyre highlights four key features of Aristotle’s ethics:

1. **Telos and virtue**: Humans are rational beings with a purpose, and virtues help fulfill that purpose.

2. **Eudaimonia**: The ultimate good life isn’t separate from virtue — it’s made of living virtuously.

3. **Practical reason**: Moral reasoning is a skill for real-life choices, not just abstract thinking.

4. **Friendship and society**: Virtue and the good life are deeply social — we pursue them together in community.

Together, these make Aristotle’s moral system rich, practical, and rooted in both personal development and social life.

#### Ethics a la MacIntyre

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - **MacIntyre** revives Aristotle’s virtue ethics for modern times.
> - Faces 4 problems: metaphysical essence, loss of polis, tragic conflict, changing virtues.
> - Solves them with: **Practices** (social activities with internal goods), **Narratives** (life as story), and **Traditions** (ongoing communal argument).
> - **Virtue** = traits that sustain the quest for the good life.
> - Moral life is a journey shaped by story, community, and shared pursuit of excellence.

###### Practices:

1. _Social & cooperative_: done with others, not in isolation.
2. _Aim at internal goods_: rewards only understood by participants.
3. _Have standards of excellence_: defined by the practitioner community.
4. _Are extended over time_: grow as people strive for excellence.

###### Narrative:

1.  Actions gain meaning only _within_ _the context_ of a life story.
2.  Our identity is shaped by the _narrative_ unity of our lives (beginning–middle–end).
3.  _Narratives are social_ — our stories intersect with others through shared roles and communities.
4.  _Virtues_ help sustain and extend our _personal and communal stories_ over time.

###### Tradition:

1.  _Historically Extended_: Traditions evolve over time, maintaining continuity through shared stories across generations.
2.  _Socially Embodied_: Traditions are lived and practiced within communities, guided by authoritative texts or voices.
3.  _Long-standing Arguments_: Traditions are ongoing debates, overcoming internal and external conflicts to redefine key principles.

MacIntyre aims to restore Aristotelian ethics but adapts it for the modern world. He replaces outdated ideas like Aristotle's biological essentialism and the polis with a framework rooted in socially shared practices, personal and communal narratives, and living traditions. Virtues, in this view, are the traits that help individuals and communities pursue a moral quest through time, even in the face of tragic conflict and change.

#### Retrospect, Conclusion

> [!example] Keynotes
>
> - MacIntyre defines virtue through a triad: **practice**, **narrative**, and **tradition**.
> - He refutes Enlightenment individualism and moral emotivism.
> - Moral norms arise from understanding the **human telos** within social-historical context.
> - Virtue sustains practices, personal life stories, and living traditions.
> - His account reframes ethics as a communal quest shaped by history and purpose.
> - Ongoing objections (e.g., pluralism, tradition conflict) are seen as part of extending the tradition.

MacIntyre reinterprets virtue ethics by showing that moral life depends on interconnected practices, narratives, and traditions. He criticizes Enlightenment thought for cutting ethics off from its social and historical roots, leading to relativism. Virtue is redefined as what enables humans to pursue their purpose (telos) across individual, communal, and historical levels. Though challenges like moral pluralism and liberalism persist, MacIntyre sees these as fuel for the ongoing development of tradition—not disproof of it. Ethics, for him, is a live, unfolding story rather than a settled system.
