##### Course Description:

This course is designed to develop a sound theological understanding for developing Christian-ethical perspectives in the changing issues of personal and social life in the contemporary world. Special methodological emphasis will be given to ethical reasoning and its philosophical presuppositions, including contemporary ethics of virtuous character and community. Christian particularity of moral reasoning will be seen in following Jesus as the Lord over all as well as being guided by the Holy Scriptures as the authoritative text in the life and conscience of Christian communities.
