# Variations On The Christian Stance

### Variations on the Christian Stance

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Unity and Difference**: All Christians share the same foundational stance—creation, sin, incarnation, redemption, resurrection—but emphasize different aspects.
> - **Augustine’s Legacy**: He modeled how to hold the whole stance while still struggling with tensions (e.g., love vs. self-denial, civic duty vs. moral limits).
> - **Contemporary Approaches**: Modern Christian ethics continues this pattern, with four major emphases shaping how Christians engage with the world.

##### Summary:

1. **Shared Framework, Varied Focus**
   - All Christian ethics builds on the same story, but practical moral choices often require prioritizing some parts of that story over others.
2. **Augustine’s Unresolved Tensions**
   - Augustine’s theology held together love of creation and suspicion of it, civic participation and moral withdrawal—these tensions still shape Christian ethics.
3. **Four Major Contemporary Perspectives**

   - **Synergy**: Cooperates with secular ethics to seek the common good.
   - **Integrity**: Stresses a distinct, countercultural Christian identity.
   - **Realism**: Emphasizes human sin and the limits of moral action.
   - **Liberation**: Focuses on justice and freedom for the oppressed.

### Synergy

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Shared Moral Ground**: People of all faiths and backgrounds can reason together about the common good.
> - **Natural Law**: Rooted in creation, natural law provides a rational basis for civil society and moral dialogue.
> - **Public Consensus**: Democracy thrives when diverse communities engage in respectful argument, not coercion.
> - **Cautions**: Cultural differences and identity struggles challenge the idea of a universal “natural reason,” but shared reasoning remains essential.

##### Summary:

1. **John Courtney Murray’s Vision**
   - Murray promoted Catholic participation in American democracy, arguing that both share roots in natural law and human dignity.
2. **Natural Law and Public Reasoning**
   - Drawing from Aquinas, Murray believed all people can use reason to seek justice, peace, and shared goods—even if they differ in faith.
3. **“Four Conspiracies”**

   - Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and secularists can work together (“breathe together”) for a just society without erasing differences.

4. **Modern Challenges**
   - Today’s religious pluralism and internal divisions complicate consensus, as people reason from different cultural and historical experiences.
5. **Enduring Hope**
   - Despite limitations, **synergy** holds that moral reasoning across traditions is possible, grounded in the belief that God’s creation is ordered and knowable

### Integrity

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Radical Witness**: Christian ethics must reflect Jesus’ life and values, not the world’s.
> - **Nonviolence & Community**: Faithful living means peace, patience, and forming a church that resists coercion and power.
> - **Critique of Politics**: All governments rely on violence; Christians must avoid confusing civic order with God’s kingdom.
> - **True Ethics**: Not universal rules or problem-solving, but living a life shaped by Christ’s story, regardless of social approval.

##### Summary:

1. **Stanley Hauerwas & Christian Distinctiveness**
   - Hauerwas rejects “quandary ethics” and calls for a Christian way of life formed by Jesus' story, not by societal norms or political agendas.
2. **Focus on Incarnation**
   - Jesus' life, death, and resurrection are the model. Ethics isn’t about solving public dilemmas, but embodying peace, love, and patience.
3. **Critique of Constantinianism**
   - Since Constantine, Christians have wrongly merged church and state. Hauerwas warns this corrupts Christian witness.
4. **Community Over Consensus**
   - The church must be a distinct, peaceable community—even when society promotes values that directly oppose Christian truth.
5. **Limitations & Criticism**
   - Critics argue this view avoids political responsibility. Christians live in real societies and often hold roles that demand engagement. Integrity can overlook these complexities and idealize the church.
6. **Enduring Value**
   - Still, **Integrity** reminds Christians to prepare for times when standing with the gospel means standing alone, without state support or public approval.

### Realism

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Takes Responsibility**: Christian ethics must guide real-world decisions, not just critique them.
> - **Emphasizes Sin**: Recognizes how self-interest and pride distort justice and peace.
> - **Balances Ideal & Reality**: Love is the standard, but moral action is limited by human frailty.
> - **Supports Democracy**: Democracy works because it checks both the power of rulers and the selfishness of the people.

##### Summary:

1. **Reinhold Niebuhr & the Realist Vision**
   - Grounded in experience with social conflict, Niebuhr called out naïve optimism and emphasized **sin** as a central reality shaping all human institutions.
2. **Moral Clarity Without Illusion**
   - Love for God and neighbor remains the Christian ideal, but we must recognize that **partial justice is still real progress**.
3. **Politics & Power**
   - Unlike Integrity (which rejects politics) or Synergy (which trusts consensus), Realism sees politics as messy but necessary. It supports **limited government**, wary of both authoritarianism and popular naïveté.
4. **Democracy’s Necessity**
   - “_Man’s capacity for justice makes democracy possible; man’s inclination to injustice makes democracy necessary._”
5. **Fall, Not Failure**
   - Even good intentions are tainted. But faith in **God’s final judgment** sustains hope, even as Christians strive for “a little more justice.”
6. **Criticisms of Realism**
   - _Hauerwas (Integrity)_: Realism compromises Christian identity.
   - _Murray (Synergy)_: Realism refuses to commit to what is right.
   - _Liberation theologians_: Realism doesn’t go far enough in confronting systemic injustice and privilege.

### Liberation

> [!important] Key Points
>
> - _Ethics starts with lived experience_ — especially of the oppressed.
> - God’s work of redemption **empowers** people to break chains of injustice.
> - Incarnation means **Jesus stands with the marginalized** — poor, colonized, crucified.
> - Liberation is both a **theological truth and a call to action** for justice.

##### Summary:

1. **Katie Geneva Cannon & Womanist Ethics**
   - Ethics arises not from abstract principles, but from **survival wisdom** in a world shaped by _race, gender, and class oppression_.
   - Virtues like “unctuousness” (sly courage under threat) become essential when **survival itself is resistance**.
2. **Liberation Theology’s Core**
   - Emerged from the **voices of the poor**, not just elite theologians advocating for them.
   - Found in _Black, Latin American, Mujerista, and Asian_ Christian communities.
   - Claims that poverty is not natural but caused by **systemic injustice** — economic, political, and religious.
3. **God in the Margins**
   - Liberation theology **centers incarnation**: Jesus identifies with the oppressed.
   - “The gospel is not offered _to_ the oppressed — it is _their own story_.” (James Cone)
   - Redemption begins when the poor recognize the power and dignity **God gives them**.
4. **Critical of Natural Law & Tradition**
   - Liberation ethics often rejects “natural law” arguments that historically justified **slavery, patriarchy, and colonialism**.
   - Resists moral systems that only serve the status quo.
5. **God’s Preferential Option for the Poor**
   - Jesus was poor and despised. Christian ethics must begin there — not with privilege.
   - Living among and listening to the poor **reorients how we understand sin, faith, and justice.**
6. **Criticism & Response**
   - _Critics_: Liberation theology is political, not theological.
   - _Liberationists_: Real faith must lead to liberation. **“Faith without justice is oppression with a halo.”**

### Stance and Society

> [!important] Key Points
>
> - _Stance_ is a **shared framework** for Christian ethics — not a single answer.
> - Differences in emphasis (creation, sin, etc.) shape **how Christians engage society**.
> - **Context matters** — your society influences how you interpret and live out your stance.
> - Disagreement is real, but **shared foundations unite all Christian ethical thinking**.

#### Summary:

1. **Stance = Shared Foundation, Varied Emphasis**
   - All Christians share the fivefold stance (creation, sin, incarnation, redemption, resurrection).
   - But they emphasize different elements:
     - _Synergy_ → highlights **creation** → seeks common ground with society.
     - _Integrity_ → highlights **incarnation** → maintains a separate Christian witness.
     - _Realism_ → emphasizes **sin** → warns of moral limits, seeks cautious participation.
     - _Liberation_ → emphasizes **incarnation + redemption** → acts to free the oppressed.
2. **Society Shapes the Response**
   - Christians respond differently depending on their **cultural-political context**.
   - Example:
     - _Bonhoeffer_, in Nazi Germany → **resisted the state** despite Lutheran tradition of obedience.
     - _Niebuhr_, in democratic USA → **defended democracy** as a realistic, moral system.
3. **Christians Live Differently in Society**
   - Some are **good citizens**, some **revolutionaries**, some use **civil disobedience**.
   - Some **expect others to agree**, others are prepared to **stand alone** in faithfulness.
4. **Disagreements vs. Shared Core**
   - The four approaches often argue — even accuse each other of betraying the Gospel.
   - But they all work within the same **Christian stance**.
   - A full understanding of Christian ethics needs **all four perspectives**, even when we prefer one.
