# Virtues, Natural And Theological

### Virtues, Natural and Theological

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Rules vs. Character**: While rules/duties help resolve large-scale or formal conflicts, virtues focus on forming the kind of person who can handle life’s moral dilemmas with wisdom.
> - **Classical Roots**: Plato and Aristotle identified four “cardinal virtues” – prudence, courage, justice, self-control.
> - **Christian Reinterpretation**: Augustine recast these virtues in light of loving God; Aquinas added the “theological virtues” (faith, hope, charity) to tie moral growth to divine relationship.
> - **Why Virtues Matter**: When two good rules collide (e.g., “Don’t abandon a friend” vs. “Don’t skip an exam”), only character traits (like compassion, perseverance, good judgment) can guide the right balance.

##### Summary:

1. **Integration of Virtues and Christian Thought**

   - Early Christian thinkers adapted ancient virtues by placing them in the context of God’s love and redemption.
   - Aquinas fully synthesized classical philosophy (aiming at human flourishing) with Augustinian theology (aiming at divine communion).

2. **Rules Alone Can Be Insufficient**

   - Deontological ethics (e.g., honor codes, legal statutes) is vital in group scenarios but may fail in personal conflicts of loyalty or urgency.
   - A purely rule-based approach can leave unresolved tension when duties conflict, as in helping a friend vs. fulfilling academic obligations.

3. **Cultivating Character**

   - Asking “What sort of person do I want to be?” reflects the essence of virtue ethics.
   - By developing traits like compassion, prudence, and courage, individuals more naturally choose rightly, even in stressful or ambiguous situations.

4. **Practical Scenario**

   - Late at night before an exam, a friend urgently needs a ride home. One must weigh the demands of academic duty and friend loyalty.
   - Beyond checking which rule to follow, virtue ethics asks how a person’s response aligns with their moral identity and future growth.

5. **Harmony of Moral Systems**
   - Virtue ethics does not reject rules or goals. It complements them by focusing on _internalizing_ goodness so that moral actions flow from one’s character.
   - In Christian terms, this includes both the “cardinal” human virtues and the distinctly “theological” virtues that shape a life oriented toward God.

### Virtue Ethics

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Beyond rules and outcomes**: Virtue ethics (areteology) emphasizes _who we become_, not just what we do.
> - **Personal qualities** (e.g., compassion, persistence, prudence) shape moral decisions more naturally than strict compliance to rules or single-minded pursuit of goals.
> - **Historical roots**: Virtue ethics dates back to Aristotle’s _Nicomachean Ethics_; modern thinkers now see it as a “third way” alongside teleology and deontology.

##### Summary:

1. **Areteology and Its Focus**

   - **Areteology**: from the Greek _arete_ (virtue), it centers on cultivating _habits_ and _character traits_ that define a “good person.”
   - Right actions flow from _who we are_ rather than from applying external rules or ends.

2. **Why Virtue?**

   - People often find themselves asking, “What kind of person do I want to be?”
   - Compassion, persistence, balance (prudence), and similar traits guide choices when rules collide or fail to address nuance.

3. **Contrast with Teleology and Deontology**

   - **Teleology**: Good actions aim at correct goals (e.g., greatest happiness, common good).
   - **Deontology**: Good actions conform to duties or rules (e.g., Kant’s categorical imperative).
   - **Virtue Ethics**: Good actions are those a _morally excellent_ person would take, reflecting well-formed character.

4. **Roots in Aristotle**

   - _Nicomachean Ethics_ systematically introduced key virtue concepts still influential today.
   - Aristotle’s insight: virtues are _habits_ acquired through repeated practice, guided by reason to aim for the mean between extremes.

5. **Modern Relevance**
   - In complex situations, purely rule-based or goal-based approaches may not suffice.
   - Virtue ethics provides a framework for aligning moral decisions with an individual’s deep-seated character and ongoing moral growth.

### Back to Aristotle

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Greek Sense of Arete**: Aristotle used arete (excellence) for any high-level skill (e.g., poetry, athletics), but ethics focuses on _moral excellence_.
> - **Mean Between Extremes**: Each virtue lies between two vices (excess and defect). Generosity, for instance, is midway between extravagance and stinginess.
> - **Practice and Habit**: Virtues must be cultivated through repeated actions until they become “second nature,” like a musician mastering an instrument.
> - **Cultural Differences**: Some Aristotelian virtues (e.g., “magnanimity”) can clash with modern or Christian ideals (like humility), reflecting distinct social values.

##### Summary:

1. **Aristotle’s Broader Notion of Arete**

   - In ancient Greece, arete could describe any notable human excellence (e.g., skill in art or war).
   - For morality, Aristotle pinpoints the qualities that make someone a _good person_ overall, not just good at a trade or craft.

2. **Moral Virtues**

   - The moral virtues form the “right measure” between two opposite vices.
   - Examples include courage (between recklessness and cowardice) and generosity (between extravagance and stinginess).

3. **Virtue as Habitual Excellence**

   - Genuine virtue isn’t momentary luck; it’s ingrained through practice.
   - A virtue becomes part of one’s character so that making the balanced, appropriate choice feels almost natural.

4. **Adjusting for Cultural Context**
   - Aristotle’s emphasis on _accurate self-estimation_ may conflict with a Christian ideal of humility.
   - Conversely, his notion of “magnanimity” (speaking slowly, acting unhurriedly) may appear pompous by modern standards, showing that virtues can shift in emphasis across cultures.

### Cardinal Virtues

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Temperance, courage, justice, and prudence** have been recognized since ancient times as “cardinal” or hinge virtues.
> - **Temperance** and **courage** involve moderating desires for pleasure and security; **justice** balances one’s entire moral life; **prudence** applies reason to guide all virtues effectively.
> - Different philosophers (e.g., Stoics, Epicureans, Platonists) interpret these virtues according to their larger worldview, yet all see them as integral to a flourishing life.
> - The Christian tradition, especially **Augustine**, reoriented these classical virtues around loving and serving God, thereby deepening their meaning.

##### Summary:

1. **Four Cardinal Virtues**

   - **Temperance (Self-control)**: Governs appetite for food, drink, entertainment, etc., finding a healthy, moderate enjoyment.
   - **Courage**: Harnesses the impulse toward honor and security, avoiding both reckless danger and undue fear.
   - **Justice**: Ensures fair treatment and distribution among people; also internally balances other virtues so one doesn’t overemphasize or neglect them.
   - **Prudence**: Uses practical wisdom to see which virtue is needed in each situation, preventing misguided or counterproductive efforts.

2. **Classical Roots**

   - Philosophers from Plato to the Stoics emphasized these virtues for social harmony and personal well-being.
   - Each philosophical school colored these virtues differently – e.g., Epicureans stressing temperance for moderate pleasure, Stoics highlighting courage and self-discipline.

3. **Shared Importance Across Cultures**

   - These four virtues appeared not only in Greek and Roman thought but also in Jewish wisdom literature; they bridged cultural and religious lines.
   - They provided a holistic framework: controlling body (temperance and courage) and mind (justice and prudence) to achieve the good life.

4. **Foundational Role**

   - Called “cardinal” (from Latin _cardo_, “hinge”) because other virtues depend on or revolve around them.
   - Missing any one virtue can undermine the rest – e.g., a “courageous” person who lacks prudence can sabotage worthy goals.

5. **From Pagan to Christian**
   - Augustine and other Christian thinkers integrated these virtues with biblical teachings on humility, love of neighbor, and reliance on God’s grace.
   - This adaptation gave the cardinal virtues renewed emphasis, centering them on faithful relationship to God rather than solely on civic prosperity or personal honor.

### Augustine on Virtue

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Shift from Greek Philosophy**: Augustine adopts the same four “cardinal” virtues (prudence, courage, temperance, justice) but redefines them in light of humanity’s relationship to God.
> - **Eternal Happiness**: True happiness, for Augustine, must be found in God alone, as all earthly goods are subject to loss.
> - **Virtue as Divine Gift**: Contrasting with Aristotle’s emphasis on practice, Augustine insists that only God can turn us from self-love to divine love.
> - **“Splendid Vices”**: Absent love of God, worldly virtues lack true moral worth – even if they appear admirable.

##### Summary:

1. **Love of God Transforms the Cardinal Virtues**

   - Where Greek and Roman thinkers saw each virtue aiming at a different good (e.g., courage pursues honor), Augustine unites them all under one goal: _love for God_.
   - Hence, temperance is “love preserving itself for God,” courage is “love enduring all for God,” etc.

2. **True Happiness in a Fallen World**

   - Augustine argues that people fear losing whatever earthly happiness they gain.
   - Only a relationship with God provides an unshakable good, impervious to sin or misfortune—even death.

3. **Grace and the Source of Virtue**

   - While Aristotle regarded moral excellences as cultivated through practice, Augustine sees humanity’s desire for God as _damaged by sin_.
   - God must restore the capacity to love Him, making virtue a _gift_ rather than purely human achievement.

4. **“Splendid Vices” and Non-Christian Morality**

   - Augustine does not deny that non-Christian behaviors can be praiseworthy, but insists that virtues unconnected to God’s love cannot be truly virtuous.
   - He fears conflating Christian virtue (focused on eternal life) with merely civic or cultural excellences.

5. **Historical Context**
   - Writing amid persecution, political unrest, and a transitioning empire, Augustine’s emphasis on unwavering devotion to God shaped how Christians defined virtue—often manifested in martyrdom, monasticism, and rigorous self-denial.

### Natural and Supernatural Ends

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Thomas Aquinas** reconciles Aristotle’s “natural” happiness with Augustine’s insistence on a “supernatural” goal (eternal life with God).

- **Natural ends** (e.g., health, achievement, prosperity) are authentic goods guided by practical reason.
- **Supernatural end**: Eternal relationship with God, exceeding the natural scope of life, made possible only by God’s gift.
- **Different kinds of virtues** help people properly balance these natural pursuits with the higher, supernatural destiny.

##### Summary:

1. **Contextual Difference**

   - Augustine wrote in a crumbling Roman world, emphasizing the stark contrast between Earthly pursuits and the eternal.
   - Thomas, in a flourishing medieval Europe, encountered renewed interest in Aristotle, striving to integrate classical knowledge with Christian theology.

2. **Aristotle’s Natural Happiness vs. Augustine’s Divine Love**

   - Aristotle sees _eudaimonia_ (happiness or flourishing) as the ultimate human goal, within the limits of mortal life.
   - Augustine insists ultimate happiness is found _only_ in loving God, beyond earthly misfortune and death.

3. **Aquinas’s Distinction**

   - **Natural end**: Humans naturally seek earthly goods (health, social achievements, etc.), per Aristotle’s account of happiness.
   - **Supernatural end**: True eternal fulfillment (as Augustine notes) rests in union with God, which is not within the scope of natural virtue alone.

4. **Two Tiers of Virtue**

   - **Natural virtues** develop through practice and serve our natural ends (à la Aristotle’s ethics).
   - **Supernatural virtues** (e.g., faith, hope, charity) orient us toward the divine relationship that goes _beyond_ mortality.

5. **Harmony Rather Than Opposition**
   - Aquinas sees no forced choice between natural aims and supernatural destiny. Each has its legitimate place, but supernatural virtue corrects and elevates natural pursuit of happiness.
   - In doing so, Aquinas systematically weaves together Aristotelian philosophy (nature-based ethics) with Augustinian spirituality (grace and eternal life).

### Different Kinds of Virtue

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Thomas Aquinas** organizes virtues into “natural” (for this-worldly ends) and “theological” (for the supernatural end of union with God).
> - **Natural virtues** include moral (e.g., courage, temperance, justice, prudence) and intellectual (e.g., arts, sciences, memory, reason) qualities; they can be acquired by practice and habit.
> - **Theological virtues** (faith, hope, love) are given by God and orient humans to their ultimate destiny – eternal life with God.
> - By distinguishing these, Aquinas balances Aristotle’s ethics (aimed at earthly flourishing) with Augustine’s emphasis on loving God above all else.

##### Summary:

1. **Natural Virtues (Moral & Intellectual)**

   - **Moral virtues** curb or channel desires toward good ends:
     - _Temperance_ (balancing pleasures)
     - _Courage_ (balancing fear and daring)
     - _Justice_ (distributing benefits/burdens fairly, both outwardly and inwardly)
     - _Prudence_ (an intellectual + moral virtue that discerns the right action in particular situations).
   - **Intellectual virtues** shape correct thinking and reasoning (e.g., foresight, memory, logic).
   - These virtues can be cultivated through repetition and habit (an Aristotelian view).

2. **Tension with Augustinian Vision**

   - Augustine insisted that only virtue directed to God is _truly_ virtuous; earthly virtues not aiming at God are at best “splendid vices.”
   - Aquinas recognizes that many virtues (e.g., “quick-wittedness”) may not obviously relate to eternal life with God.

3. **Aquinas’s Innovation**

   - **Supernatural end**: Humans have a higher goal than mere earthly flourishing – eternal communion with God.
   - **Theological virtues** – faith, hope, and love – are _infused_ by God, enabling orientation to the supernatural.
   - Natural virtues aim at our _earthly happiness_, while theological virtues direct us beyond mortality to God’s eternal design.

4. **Why Two Sets of Virtues?**
   - The “natural” set addresses human nature (shared by all, guided by reason).
   - The “theological” set grants what we can’t achieve through human effort alone – it’s God’s gift transforming our hearts and final aims.
   - This structure lets Aquinas integrate Augustine’s concern for divine love with Aristotle’s emphasis on developing good habits in daily life.

### The Theological Virtues

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Faith, hope, and love** (1 Corinthians 13:13) orient people toward a _supernatural end_ – eternal life with God.
> - Unlike moral and intellectual virtues (acquired by practice), these theological virtues are **infused** by God.
> - They can be deficient (e.g., weak faith), but never excessive (there’s no “too much” faith or love).
> - **Infused moral virtues** parallel the cardinal virtues in those completely oriented toward God.

##### Summary:

1. **Faith, Hope, Love: Beyond Natural Goals**

   - **Faith** offers special knowledge about God and our ultimate destiny, above and beyond what reason discovers of creation.
   - **Hope** directs the will to persevere toward this eternal relationship, surpassing fear of earthly loss.
   - **Love (Charity)** flows from – and strengthens – faith and hope, aligning all desire with God.

2. **Contrast with Natural Virtues**

   - **Natural moral virtues** (temperance, courage, justice, prudence) focus on earthly flourishing (Aristotelian eudaimonia).
   - **Theological virtues** aim at the _supernatural end_, lasting union with God that cannot be lost even in death.
   - One acquires natural virtues by training and habit, whereas theological virtues come purely as a gift.

3. **Infused Moral Virtues**

   - Augustine questioned whether naturally developed virtues could really serve love of God.
   - Aquinas’s solution: the moral virtues can be “infused” by grace, reoriented toward a higher purpose.
   - Thus a believer can practice temperance, courage, justice, and prudence in a way that sustains faith, hope, and love.

4. **Political vs. Purifying Virtues**

   - Borrowing from Neoplatonism, Aquinas distinguishes two uses of the cardinal virtues:
     - **Political**: for everyday human affairs, shared by all.
     - **Purifying**: in the “infused” sense, molded by faith and hope, perfecting them for communion with God.

5. **Result: An Integrated Vision**
   - Aquinas unites Aristotelian ethics (habitual formation of virtues) with Augustine’s emphasis on grace and divine love.
   - Christians still operate within normal social life (“political” virtues), yet faith, hope, and love elevate their moral actions to fulfill a supernatural calling.

### Thomistic Synergy

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Aquinas** harmonizes Aristotle’s natural virtues with Augustine’s emphasis on divine love, integrating the moral and the theological into one cohesive vision.
> - **Unity of the Virtues**: Infused “theological” virtues (faith, hope, charity) also elevate and perfect the “natural” virtues (prudence, courage, justice, temperance).
> - **Synergy in Action**: Neither do Christians abandon natural goods like culture, knowledge, and political life, nor do they idolize them – rather, these human goods are oriented toward and completed by relationship with God.
> - **Checks and Balances**: While Christians fully engage in social endeavors, faith reminds them that no earthly institution or mission is an ultimate end.

##### Summary:

1. **Completing the Natural with the Supernatural**

   - Aquinas structures a system where the theological virtues (infused by God) ensure the perfection of natural virtues gained through practice.
   - This prevents an “either–or” conflict between earthly fulfillment (Aristotle) and eternal communion with God (Augustine).

2. **Unity of the Virtues**

   - If charity (love of God) is infused, so are all necessary moral virtues, enabling a life that’s morally upright across every domain.
   - In Aquinas’s words, charity orients each good work “to his ultimate end,” so virtue in any sphere also points beyond itself to God.

3. **Synergy in Public Life**

   - For Aquinas, Christians need not reject or diminish social, cultural, or intellectual pursuits.
   - Properly infused with grace, believers can excel in civic virtues, contributing richly to society while never mistaking political goals for the final, supernatural end.

4. **No Idolatry of Earthly Ends**

   - Even laudable pursuits – institutions, political aims, national causes – remain finite.
   - The “integrity of faith” stays intact only when believers remember that such goods, though valuable, must not replace God as the ultimate goal.

5. **Lasting Influence**
   - Aquinas’s Summa theologiae forged a broad “Thomistic synergy” in Catholic thought, framing faith and reason, grace and nature, as mutually illuminating.
   - This balancing act continues to guide Christian ethics, inspiring believers to seek both robust engagement in worldly endeavors and deep devotion to God’s eternal purposes.

### Virtue After Thomas Aquinas

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - Even though Aquinas’s vision united natural and supernatural virtues, practical realities often weakened this “unity of the virtues.”
> - **Catherine of Siena** (1347–1380) exemplified a more personal style of uniting love for God with civic and ecclesial responsibilities.
> - The Reformation sparked deep changes: Luther emphasized sin and grace over virtue, Calvin stressed daily scriptural guidance rather than ingrained habit, and Catholic leaders in turn focused on specific moral rules.
> - Only recently have many Christian ethicists, both Catholic and Protestant, begun to rediscover and develop virtue ethics again.

##### Summary:

1. **Aquinas’s Legacy vs. Real Life**

   - Aquinas harmonized faith and morality into a coherent system: divine love should perfect and elevate natural virtues.
   - In practice, Christians sometimes found devotion to God overshadowing normal social virtues, while others fragmented into purely “practical achievements.”

2. **Catherine of Siena’s Example**

   - Born into a merchant family in Siena, Catherine combined intense prayer with bold public engagement.
   - She drew the Pope back to Rome, illustrating how love of God can empower political negotiation and social reform.
   - Her concept of each person having a “primary virtue,” then drawing the rest via love, parallels Aquinas’s unity of virtues.

3. **Implications of the Reformation**

   - **Luther**: anxious that virtues might become self-righteous “possessions,” instead stressed God’s grace and restraining sin.
   - **Calvin**: daily scripture reading, not habit, steers moral life; infused virtue appears less central than God’s direct commands.
   - Catholic responses also focused more on codified rules, diminishing the emphasis on virtue formation.

4. **A Gradual Shift Away from Virtue**

   - Religious strife and new legal requirements made obedience or rule-following seem more urgent than forming virtuous character.
   - As a result, deontological approaches dominated both Protestant and Catholic ethics from the 16th century onward.

5. **Modern Revival of Virtue Ethics**
   - Many contemporary theologians across denominations are returning to **virtue** as central to moral life, revisiting insights from Augustine, Aquinas, and figures like Catherine of Siena.
   - This renewed focus could reshape how Christian ethics addresses personal integrity, social engagement, and spiritual devotion.

   - Augustine insists ultimate happiness is found _only_ in loving God, beyond earthly misfortune and death.

3. **Aquinas’s Distinction**

   - **Natural end**: Humans naturally seek earthly goods (health, social achievements, etc.), per Aristotle’s account of happiness.
   - **Supernatural end**: True eternal fulfillment (as Augustine notes) rests in union with God, which is not within the scope of natural virtue alone.

4. **Two Tiers of Virtue**

   - **Natural virtues** develop through practice and serve our natural ends (à la Aristotle’s ethics).
   - **Supernatural virtues** (e.g., faith, hope, charity) orient us toward the divine relationship that goes _beyond_ mortality.

5. **Harmony Rather Than Opposition**
   - Aquinas sees no forced choice between natural aims and supernatural destiny. Each has its legitimate place, but supernatural virtue corrects and elevates natural pursuit of happiness.
   - In doing so, Aquinas systematically weaves together Aristotelian philosophy (nature-based ethics) with Augustinian spirituality (grace and eternal life).

### Different Kinds of Virtue

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Thomas Aquinas** organizes virtues into “natural” (for this-worldly ends) and “theological” (for the supernatural end of union with God).
> - **Natural virtues** include moral (e.g., courage, temperance, justice, prudence) and intellectual (e.g., arts, sciences, memory, reason) qualities; they can be acquired by practice and habit.
> - **Theological virtues** (faith, hope, love) are given by God and orient humans to their ultimate destiny – eternal life with God.
> - By distinguishing these, Aquinas balances Aristotle’s ethics (aimed at earthly flourishing) with Augustine’s emphasis on loving God above all else.

##### Summary:

1. **Natural Virtues (Moral & Intellectual)**

   - **Moral virtues** curb or channel desires toward good ends:
     - _Temperance_ (balancing pleasures)
     - _Courage_ (balancing fear and daring)
     - _Justice_ (distributing benefits/burdens fairly, both outwardly and inwardly)
     - _Prudence_ (an intellectual + moral virtue that discerns the right action in particular situations).
   - **Intellectual virtues** shape correct thinking and reasoning (e.g., foresight, memory, logic).
   - These virtues can be cultivated through repetition and habit (an Aristotelian view).

2. **Tension with Augustinian Vision**

   - Augustine insisted that only virtue directed to God is _truly_ virtuous; earthly virtues not aiming at God are at best “splendid vices.”
   - Aquinas recognizes that many virtues (e.g., “quick-wittedness”) may not obviously relate to eternal life with God.

3. **Aquinas’s Innovation**

   - **Supernatural end**: Humans have a higher goal than mere earthly flourishing – eternal communion with God.
   - **Theological virtues** – faith, hope, and love – are _infused_ by God, enabling orientation to the supernatural.
   - Natural virtues aim at our _earthly happiness_, while theological virtues direct us beyond mortality to God’s eternal design.

4. **Why Two Sets of Virtues?**
   - The “natural” set addresses human nature (shared by all, guided by reason).
   - The “theological” set grants what we can’t achieve through human effort alone – it’s God’s gift transforming our hearts and final aims.
   - This structure lets Aquinas integrate Augustine’s concern for divine love with Aristotle’s emphasis on developing good habits in daily life.

### The Theological Virtues

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Faith, hope, and love** (1 Corinthians 13:13) orient people toward a _supernatural end_ – eternal life with God.
> - Unlike moral and intellectual virtues (acquired by practice), these theological virtues are **infused** by God.
> - They can be deficient (e.g., weak faith), but never excessive (there’s no “too much” faith or love).
> - **Infused moral virtues** parallel the cardinal virtues in those completely oriented toward God.

##### Summary:

1. **Faith, Hope, Love: Beyond Natural Goals**

   - **Faith** offers special knowledge about God and our ultimate destiny, above and beyond what reason discovers of creation.
   - **Hope** directs the will to persevere toward this eternal relationship, surpassing fear of earthly loss.
   - **Love (Charity)** flows from – and strengthens – faith and hope, aligning all desire with God.

2. **Contrast with Natural Virtues**

   - **Natural moral virtues** (temperance, courage, justice, prudence) focus on earthly flourishing (Aristotelian eudaimonia).
   - **Theological virtues** aim at the _supernatural end_, lasting union with God that cannot be lost even in death.
   - One acquires natural virtues by training and habit, whereas theological virtues come purely as a gift.

3. **Infused Moral Virtues**

   - Augustine questioned whether naturally developed virtues could really serve love of God.
   - Aquinas’s solution: the moral virtues can be “infused” by grace, reoriented toward a higher purpose.
   - Thus a believer can practice temperance, courage, justice, and prudence in a way that sustains faith, hope, and love.

4. **Political vs. Purifying Virtues**

   - Borrowing from Neoplatonism, Aquinas distinguishes two uses of the cardinal virtues:
     - **Political**: for everyday human affairs, shared by all.
     - **Purifying**: in the “infused” sense, molded by faith and hope, perfecting them for communion with God.

5. **Result: An Integrated Vision**
   - Aquinas unites Aristotelian ethics (habitual formation of virtues) with Augustine’s emphasis on grace and divine love.
   - Christians still operate within normal social life (“political” virtues), yet faith, hope, and love elevate their moral actions to fulfill a supernatural calling.

### Thomistic Synergy

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - **Aquinas** harmonizes Aristotle’s natural virtues with Augustine’s emphasis on divine love, integrating the moral and the theological into one cohesive vision.
> - **Unity of the Virtues**: Infused “theological” virtues (faith, hope, charity) also elevate and perfect the “natural” virtues (prudence, courage, justice, temperance).
> - **Synergy in Action**: Neither do Christians abandon natural goods like culture, knowledge, and political life, nor do they idolize them – rather, these human goods are oriented toward and completed by relationship with God.
> - **Checks and Balances**: While Christians fully engage in social endeavors, faith reminds them that no earthly institution or mission is an ultimate end.

##### Summary:

1. **Completing the Natural with the Supernatural**

   - Aquinas structures a system where the theological virtues (infused by God) ensure the perfection of natural virtues gained through practice.
   - This prevents an “either–or” conflict between earthly fulfillment (Aristotle) and eternal communion with God (Augustine).

2. **Unity of the Virtues**

   - If charity (love of God) is infused, so are all necessary moral virtues, enabling a life that’s morally upright across every domain.
   - In Aquinas’s words, charity orients each good work “to his ultimate end,” so virtue in any sphere also points beyond itself to God.

3. **Synergy in Public Life**

   - For Aquinas, Christians need not reject or diminish social, cultural, or intellectual pursuits.
   - Properly infused with grace, believers can excel in civic virtues, contributing richly to society while never mistaking political goals for the final, supernatural end.

4. **No Idolatry of Earthly Ends**

   - Even laudable pursuits – institutions, political aims, national causes – remain finite.
   - The “integrity of faith” stays intact only when believers remember that such goods, though valuable, must not replace God as the ultimate goal.

5. **Lasting Influence**
   - Aquinas’s Summa theologiae forged a broad “Thomistic synergy” in Catholic thought, framing faith and reason, grace and nature, as mutually illuminating.
   - This balancing act continues to guide Christian ethics, inspiring believers to seek both robust engagement in worldly endeavors and deep devotion to God’s eternal purposes.

### Virtue After Thomas Aquinas

> [!tip] Key Points
>
> - Even though Aquinas’s vision united natural and supernatural virtues, practical realities often weakened this “unity of the virtues.”
> - **Catherine of Siena** (1347–1380) exemplified a more personal style of uniting love for God with civic and ecclesial responsibilities.
> - The Reformation sparked deep changes: Luther emphasized sin and grace over virtue, Calvin stressed daily scriptural guidance rather than ingrained habit, and Catholic leaders in turn focused on specific moral rules.
> - Only recently have many Christian ethicists, both Catholic and Protestant, begun to rediscover and develop virtue ethics again.

##### Summary:

1. **Aquinas’s Legacy vs. Real Life**

   - Aquinas harmonized faith and morality into a coherent system: divine love should perfect and elevate natural virtues.
   - In practice, Christians sometimes found devotion to God overshadowing normal social virtues, while others fragmented into purely “practical achievements.”

2. **Catherine of Siena’s Example**

   - Born into a merchant family in Siena, Catherine combined intense prayer with bold public engagement.
   - She drew the Pope back to Rome, illustrating how love of God can empower political negotiation and social reform.
   - Her concept of each person having a “primary virtue,” then drawing the rest via love, parallels Aquinas’s unity of virtues.

3. **Implications of the Reformation**

   - **Luther**: anxious that virtues might become self-righteous “possessions,” instead stressed God’s grace and restraining sin.
   - **Calvin**: daily scripture reading, not habit, steers moral life; infused virtue appears less central than God’s direct commands.
   - Catholic responses also focused more on codified rules, diminishing the emphasis on virtue formation.

4. **A Gradual Shift Away from Virtue**

   - Religious strife and new legal requirements made obedience or rule-following seem more urgent than forming virtuous character.
   - As a result, deontological approaches dominated both Protestant and Catholic ethics from the 16th century onward.

5. **Modern Revival of Virtue Ethics**
   - Many contemporary theologians across denominations are returning to **virtue** as central to moral life, revisiting insights from Augustine, Aquinas, and figures like Catherine of Siena.
   - This renewed focus could reshape how Christian ethics addresses personal integrity, social engagement, and spiritual devotion.
